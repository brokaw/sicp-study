Graphing with higher-order procedures


Relevant section in text: 1.3

The assignment develops a representation of points in the plane as procedures that take 0 or 1 as an argument and returns, correspondingly, an x or y coordinate. (This is precisely the procedural representation of pairs described in section 2.1.3.) Starting with this, students build a functional language of curves and transformations on curves, including a recursive transformation that draws fractal curves.
This assignment can be a bit mindblowing, since it gives such a fast immersion into higher-order procedures.
