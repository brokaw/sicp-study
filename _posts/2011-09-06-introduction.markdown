This repository is my attempt to document my study of _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_. I started blogging some of the material on a Blogger site, but that was a pain to post. I was already keeping my Scheme source in a git repository, so moving everything over into a combined GitHub repository seemed natural. GitHub's Pages lets me have several things, all integrated in a single, versioned repository:

* Scheme source code
	* [Code from the book](https://github.com/brokaw/sicp-study/tree/master/allcode)
	* [My solutions to the exercises](https://github.com/brokaw/sicp-study/tree/master/exercises)
* [Essays on the solutions](http://brokaw.github.com/sicp-study/solutions/)
* [Notes on the text or video lectures](http://brokaw.github.com/sicp-study/notes/)
* This blog, which I'll use to document my process and experience.

I'm just getting started with Jekyll, so things will probably change a lot as I figure out the best way to organize and generate the site.
