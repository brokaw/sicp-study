title: Orders of growth

Yesterday I backtracked my progress and worked on an exercise from chapter 1. For the most part I've been pretty good about doing the exercises, but for some reason I skipped exercise 1.14. I realized it when I started having difficulty analyzing the order of growth for exercise 2.63. Today I submitted a draft solution to 1.14, and will finish up a draft solution to 2.63.

I'm not sure how well this book prepares the student to answer order-of-growth questions beyond recognizing recursion and developing a general feeling for how recursive processes grow. In review, I noticed that the authors blithely point out that the order of growth of the tree-recursive Fibonacci is $\Theta(\phi^{n})$, and never explain how that is deduced. Maybe if I understood the relationship between the Fibocacci sequence and the golden ration it would be clearer. This raises the question (again) of how much math is required to successfully complete SICP. I've noted elsewhere that I felt a background in Calculus in general and familiarity with Simpson's rule in particular helped out in the earlier exercises, even if that background wasn't strictly required.

For now, my decision is to give a best-effort solution to all order-of-growth questions.
